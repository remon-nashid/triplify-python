This file contains the configuration for triplify.
Triplify rapidly simplifies the creation of structured content for Web 2.0
mashups and Semantic Web applications.
Triplyfy uses a number of SQL queries, whose results are converted into
either RDF/N3, JSON or Linked Data.

Triplify uses URIs to identify objects. In order to simplify their handling
you should define shortcuts (i.e. namespace prefixes) for all namespaces
from which you want to use URIs.
A 'vocabulary' entry entry is mandatory - it specifies, which default prefix
should be used for vocabulary elements such as classes and properties. Other
than the prefix for instances this prefix should be shared between different
installations of a certain Web application on the Web.

"""
The core of triplify are SQL queries, which select the information to be made
available.
You can provide a number of arbitrary queries. Each query, however, should
select information about an object of a certain type. This type, which serves
as an index in the associative queries configuration array, is also used to
construct corresponding URIs for the objects returned by the query.
The first column returned by the query represents the ID of the object and
has to be named "id", all other columns represent characteristics (or
properties of this object). As column identifier you should reuse existing
vocabularies whenever possible. If your "user" table, for example, contains a
column named "first_name" this can be easily mapped to the corresponding FOAF
property using: "SELECT id,first_name AS 'foaf:firstName' FROM user".
You can use the following column naming convention in order to inform
Triplify about the datatype or language of a column:
SELECT id,price AS 'price^^xsd:decimal',desc AS 'rdf:label@en' FROM products
However, Triplify tries to autodetect and convert timestamps appropriately.
Similarly, you can indicate that a column represents an objectProperty
pointing to other objects (foreign key):
SELECT id,user_id 'sioc:has_creator->user'
Oonly select information, which does not contain sensitive information and
can be made public. For example, email adresses and password (hashes) should
never be exposed. However, you can use the database function SHA to
mask email addresses, e.g.:
SELECT SHA(CONCAT('mailto:',email)) AS 'foaf:mbox_sha1sum' FROM users
The following queries are example queries and have to be replaced by queries
suitable for your database schema.
